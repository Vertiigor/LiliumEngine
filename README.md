### LiliumEngine is a small and simple game engine for creating visual novel games based on .Net programming languages (F#, C#, Visual Basic)

## 🧐 What is it?

### LiliumEngine is a game engine for creating projects in the genre of "visual novels".
The project was inspired by the more popular Renpy engine and provides high-level functions for creating a game:
- Text output in the form of replicas of characters and the author.
- Playing audio files in formats: `.wav`, `.ogg` and `.flac`.
- Basic UI elements:
  - Buttons
  - Checkboxes
  - Images
  - Text
- Easy transition between game scenes and adding your own.
- The ability to develop on the main ones .Net languages: `C#`, `F#`, `Visual Basic`.

### This engine is well suited for simple games, game jams, prototyping, training novice developers or schoolchildren.
